# wsdl2file - Reduce a Web Services Description down to a single file

This script walks a WSDL definition and all of its dependencies and reduces
it down to a single file, being careful to not repeat the same dependency
twice. It is useful when attempting to import large, complicated WSDL
definitions, for example, those generated by Microsoft WCF.

There are several other tools out there that attempt to flatten WSDL, but they
usually repeat definitions in dependencies each time a dependency is
referenced, resulting in very large, unruly output that can break code
generators or client libraries like
[Zeep](https://docs.python-zeep.org/en/master/) and
[Suds](https://github.com/suds-community/suds).
